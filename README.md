This repository contains Python programs to demonstrate my learning journey through fundamental programming concepts, including but not limited to:

Escape characters for formatting text
Variables and their usage
Operators for calculations and comparisons
Python keywords and their rules
Type casting to change data types
String handling, slicing, and modifications
Conditional statements for decision-making
A great starting point for anyone exploring Python basics!
